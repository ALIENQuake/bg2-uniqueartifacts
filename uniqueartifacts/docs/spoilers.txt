X. SPOILERS:

quests in BG1 I meant:

Unshey's belt (Golden Girdle)
Zhurlong's boots (Boots of Stealth)
Lucky Amulet (Baldur's Gate city, Nadine and her son Eric - Amulet of protection +1 and Necklace of Missiles)
Gauntlets of Weapon Skill (some mercenary girl in Baldur's Gate city asks to find them for her)
If you give these items to them, you'll not see them again till BG2.


new ToB game issues:
strict: Lazarus' store is ring of fire resistance, boots of speed

expanded: Lazarus' store is missing robes of archmagi, ring of fire resistance, boots of speed
